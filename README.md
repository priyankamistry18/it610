Systems Administration project 
Developing Codespace Sever and Finding Solutions To Code space Servers Problems.
this project, I will start from the webpack file by adding some lines which will ensure that dependencies are installed in the codespaces containers. So the first step is to install the 
dependencies. The second step will involve the execution of the webpack by adding a custom one to the script. The next step will be to command the VSCode on how our project should start. This command involves editing the VSCode task file to include some more tasks. After the 
command I will have to edit on the host to start to launch Azure Functions Core Tools. I will 
install the live server extension into the configuration file. At this point, the server will be under 
URL http://localhost:5500.
